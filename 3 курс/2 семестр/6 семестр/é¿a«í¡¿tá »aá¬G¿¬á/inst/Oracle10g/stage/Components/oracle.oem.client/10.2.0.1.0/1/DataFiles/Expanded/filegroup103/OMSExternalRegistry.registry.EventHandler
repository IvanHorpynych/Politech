### ENTRIES FOR THE EVENT HANDLER
###  Add these entries to the $ORACLE_HOME/sysman/config/OMSExternalRegistry.registry file to start up the
###    Event Handler as an OMS service.
###
###  Make sure there are NO <linefeed> or <Carriage Return> characters within each entry.
###
###  Before adding the entries, substitute the appropriate values for:
###    <oracle-home> ==> the specific ORACLE HOME directory where Enterprise Manager was installed
###            Example:  /private/app/oracle/8.1.6
###    <OMS User> ==> A valid OMS user account 
###            Example:  sysman
###    <OMS Password> ==> The corresponding password to the OMS user
###            Example:  oem_temp
###    <OMS nodename> ==>  name of the machine where the OMS is running
###            Example:  prodsun1
