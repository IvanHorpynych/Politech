OpenGL Tutorial 1.5: Creating wireframe images

Objective: to be able to selectively render wireframe objects

this project shows how to:
-use the GlPolygonMode to render objects using wireframes, points or
 solid poligons.

Notes:
- Although the rendering is done with wireframes, the faces are still
  one-sided, so the object is not "apparently" completely transparent.
