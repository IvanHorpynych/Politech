OpenGL Tutorial 5.1: special effects: FOG

Objective: Use the Fog special effect that is included in OpenGL


I still have a lot of trouble with this tutorial:  I suspect that
the OpenGL superbible is wrong, because I notice that the behavior
of the OpenGL fog is different of what the book tells.

I would really appreciate any help in this tutorial.
