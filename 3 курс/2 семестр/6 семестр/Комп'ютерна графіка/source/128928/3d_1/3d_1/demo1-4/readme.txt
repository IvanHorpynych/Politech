OpenGL Tutorial 1.4: interaction with a 3D object with the mouse

Objective: to be able to manipulate a 3D object with a 2D pointing device, such as the mouse.

this project shows how to:
-use the 3Dmouse class, which enables the mouse for the manipulation of 3D objects.

Suggestions:
-There are surely better ways to manipulate a 3D object with the mouse, a good one should make the user feel in complete control of the object he or she is manipulating.
-With this class you can´t have control over more than one object at the same time.
-It would be nicier if you could select the object to be modified by pointing to it with the mouse´s arrow.
