<span class="header">Chapter 1. C# and .NET Programming</span>
<p>Learning C# introduces C# specifically, and the .NET development platform more generally, to programmers with little or no object-oriented programming experience. Along the way, you will learn a great deal about writing high-quality, industrial-strength programs for .NET.</p> 
<p>This brief introduction will show you how C# fits into the .NET picture, what you can do with the language, and what benefits this language has over its predecessors.</p> 
<p>You will also learn some of the concepts integral to object-oriented programming, which has revolutionized how web and Windows applications are developed. Object-oriented programming is closely tied to the semantics of the C# language, that is, the meaning behind the code you write. Obviously, you need to have a basic understanding of the syntax of the C# language, but you also need to understand what you are actually trying to accomplish.</p>
