Fifteen Puzzle - a puzzle, which is 15 square tiles with marked numbers from 1 
to 15. 
All the knuckles are enclosed in a square box size 4x4 (side of the square box
  is four times longer than that of the knuckles). 
Thus when placing the tiles in the box is one empty space the size of a domino 
  that can be used to move the tiles inside the box. 
The goal - to streamline the placement of the numbers in the box, placing them 
  in ascending from top to bottom and left to right, 
  starting with the knuckles with the number 1 in the upper left corner and 
  ending with an empty space in the lower right corner of the box.
